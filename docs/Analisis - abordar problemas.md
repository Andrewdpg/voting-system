### Detailed Guide on Addressing Requirements and Application Flow

#### Introduction
This guide explains how various problems encountered during the requirements analysis were addressed using specific design patterns. It also provides a detailed explanation of the overall application flow.

### QAW Scenarios and Solutions

#### Scenario 1: High Concurrent Query Load
**Business Goal:** Ensure that 100 million potential voters can efficiently check their voting stations during peak times without service interruption.

**Quality Attributes:** Performance, Scalability

**Stimulus:** Multiple citizens simultaneously querying their voting stations.

**Solution:**
- **Patterns Applied:**
  - **Broker Pattern:** IceGrid is used to distribute the system components across different servers.
  - **ThreadPool Pattern:** Used for handling concurrent query processing efficiently.
  
- **Implementation:**
  - **Publisher:** Reads citizen ID files and distributes queries among subscribed clients.
  - **Clients:** Receive queries from the publisher and process them concurrently using a thread pool.
  - **Workers:** Perform the actual query processing and interact with the database to fetch results.
  - **Database:** Handles requests from workers and returns results.

**Flow:**
1. **Deployment:** The system is deployed using IceGrid, distributing components across multiple servers.
2. **Client Processing:** Clients process queries concurrently using a thread pool and send results back to the publisher.
3. **Worker Processing:** Workers fetch data from the database and return results to clients.

#### Scenario 2: Server Failure
**Business Goal:** Ensure continuous service availability in case of server failures.

**Quality Attributes:** Availability, Reliability

**Stimulus:** Unexpected failure of the main query server.

**Solution:**
- **Patterns Applied:**
  - **Broker Pattern:** IceGrid is used to manage and distribute service instances across multiple servers.
  - **Failover Mechanism:** Redirection of queries to backup servers in case of failure.

- **Implementation:**
  - **IceGrid Configuration:** Configured to automatically redirect queries to backup servers if the main server fails.
  - **Service Redundancy:** Multiple instances of the query service are deployed across different servers.

**Flow:**
1. **Failure Detection:** IceGrid detects the failure of the main server.
2. **Failover:** Queries are redirected to backup servers.
